  * Pioneers in the field, Cateora, Gilly, and Graham continue to set the standard in this 18th edition of International Marketing with their well-rounded perspective of international markets that encompass history, geography, language, and religion as well as economics, which helps students see the cultural and environmental uniqueness of any nation or region. The dynamic nature of the international marketplace is reflected in the number of substantially improved and expanded topics in this 18th, including the following over 100 new academic articles and their findings. All data, text, photos and images have been updated for currency, as has the corresponding content within McGraw-Hill Education’s Connect with adaptive SmartBook. Additional updates include:NEW Cases: New cases accompany the 18e, enlivening the material in the book and class discussions while broadening a student’s critical thinking skills. These cases bring forth many of the topics discussed in the chapters and demonstrate how these concepts are dealt with in the real world. These cases can be assigned in Connect and SmartBook. Optionally, a case booklet can be create using McGraw-Hill CREATE.
  * Crossing Borders Boxes: These invaluable boxes offer anecdotal company examples. These entertaining examples are designed to encourage critical thinking and guide students through topics ranging from ethical to cultural to global issues facing marketers today.
  * 4-Color Design: New color maps and exhibits allow for improved pedagogy and a clearer presentation of international symbols and cultural meanings in marketing and advertising. In addition, photos that depend on full color for maximum impact easily bring many global examples to life.
